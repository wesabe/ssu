# This is the login part of the <%= org %>
# script, included by <%= script_path %>.coffee one level up.

# This part handles logging in, and contains all the

wesabe.provide "fi-scripts.<%= fid %>.login",
  # This is your opportunity to look at the page, figure
  # out where you are, and go to the next page, trigger a
  # download, or pass/fail the job.
  #
  # page - A dom/Page providing access to the just-loaded page,
  #        allows finding things on the page, filling in forms, etc.
  #        While most of the time this will be the top-level Page in
  #        a Browser, it might also represent a frame inside another
  #        Page.
  #
  # browser - A dom/Browser allows navigating away from the current
  #           URL and getting the current top-level URL.
  #
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   # update the job status to say you're logging in
  #   @job.update 'auth.creds'
  #
  #   # fail the current job because the user credentials are wrong
  #   @job.fail 401, 'auth.creds.invalid'
  #
  #   # pass the current job because you got what you came here for
  #   @job.succeed()
  #
  #
  #   # temporarily store a list of account numbers for use later
  #   @tmp.accountNumbers = (option.value for option in page.select @e.accounts.options)
  #
  #   # NOTE: You may NOT store page elements in @tmp.
  #   # Any page elements retrieved using page.find(), page.select(), etc
  #   # will likely not be valid the next time you try to do something
  #   # with them, for example passing them to page.click().
  #
  dispatch: (browser, page) ->
    # replace with your own custom logic for determining login status
    return if page.present @e.logoff.link

    # replace with your own custom logic for how to log in
    #   NOTE: the order of the below is important
    #
    #   If you were to look for the username text field first
    #   then you would miss a possible error message on most
    #   websites, which show both an error message and the same
    #   form for the user to fill out again.
    #
    #   Because of this fact your dispatch will often start to look
    #   like it's doing things backwards, looking for the cases that
    #   come later, like errors logging in, before the cases that
    #   chronologically precede them, like doing the actual login.

  # Actions are discrete steps that can be taken,
  # and often leave the current page, triggering
  # another call to dispatch.
  #
  # An example might be "login", as shown below,
  # which fills out the login form and submits it.
  #
  actions:
    # sample -- replace this with your own custom logic
    login: (browser, page) ->
      page.fill @e.login.user.field, @answers.username
      page.fill @e.login.pass.field, @answers.password

      # load, which then calls dispatch again -- hopefully as a
      # logged-in user this time
